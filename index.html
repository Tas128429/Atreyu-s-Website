                <h3>Cpu</h3>
                <p>The CPU is the brains of a computer. It handles mostly all of the computing processes a computer has. It also can provide other useful power to the system for certain tasks depending on what application is being processed on the device.</p>

            <h3>Case</h3>
            <p>The Case is what holds all of the insides of a computer. Everything that ranges from the motherboard to the actual brains or the cpu of the computer are help in the case. The case holds all parts that make up the computer so it can stay cool while it is doing all of that processing.</p>

            <h3>The MotherBoard</h3>
            <p>The Motherboard is what makes sure all of of the power is going to the right parts of the computer. The motherboard is responsible for some other parts of the processes of the computer. It is also responsible for keeping the computer under control with all of the applications on the computer.</p>
